        "1. What is the difference between interpreted and compiled languages?\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans:- Interpreted languages execute code line-by-line using an interpreter (e.g., Python), making them easier to debug but slower.\n",
        "Compiled languages convert code into machine code before execution (e.g., C, C++), making them faster.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. What is exception handling in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans:- Exception handling is a mechanism that allows a program to respond to errors gracefully using try, except, else, and finally.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. What is the purpose of the finally block in exception handling?\n",
        "\n",

        "\n",
        "Ans:-\n",

        "9. What is the difference between multithreading and multiprocessing?\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans:-\n",
        " - Multithreading: multiple threads share the same memory; used for I/O tasks.\n",
        " - Multiprocessing: multiple processes have separate memory; used for CPU-heavy tasks.\n",
        "\n",
        "10. What are the advantages of using logging in a program?\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans:-\n",
        " - Helps in debugging\n",

        "\n",
        "11. What is memory management in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans:- Memory management refers to how Python allocates, uses, and frees memory automatically using garbage collection and reference counting.\n",
        "\n",
        "12. What are the basic steps involved in exception handling in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans:-\n",
        "try → code that might cause an error\n",
        "except → handles the error\n",
        "else → runs if no error occurs\n",
        "finally → always executes\n",
        "\n",
        "13. Why is memory management important in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans:- It prevents memory leaks, improves performance, and ensures efficient resource usage.\n",
        "\n",
        "14. What is the role of try and except in exception handling?\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans:-\n",
        "try: contains code that may raise an error\n",
        "except: defines how the program should respond to that error\n",
        "\n",
        "15. How does Python’s garbage collection system work?\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans:-\n",
        "Python uses:\n",
        "Reference counting (primary method)\n",
        "Cyclic garbage collector (removes circular references)\n",
        "\n",
        "16. What is the purpose of the else block in exception handling?\n",
        "\n",
